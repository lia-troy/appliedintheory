Hi, I’m Lia, a mathematician converting to software engineering.
I graduated with a Bachelor’s in Mathematics from the University of Chicago in 2020.
I’m currently living the Start-Up Nation dream in Israel,
working at NextSilicon on embedded algorithms for compilers.

I moved to Jerusalem from Montreal, Canada when I was 12.
I didn’t speak Hebrew before I moved.
Even though I was able to pick up conversational Hebrew, I still struggled in most classes.
Very quickly, I gravitated towards math and science.
Most of the technical terms are variations on the Latin in all languages anyway.
I could also easily find explanations online for anything that I didn’t understand in class.

When I began studying for my degree in math at UChicago,
I discovered that higher level math is usually explained in extremely archaic English.
Having spent years in Hebrew-speaking schools,
I was already familiar with the feeling of not fully understanding what happens during class,
and needing to put in all those extra hours just to understand the material.
For me, frantically writing everything on the board while just understanding a small portion and needing to reread slowly after class was … well … normal.
Just as when I learned Hebrew, over time,
I was able to understand more and more of what was going on in class in real-time.

Looking back, I feel like that initial period of feeling completely lost in class was the biggest obstacle I faced.
Yes, a lot of it was just that the material is complex and I was really learning to think in new terms.
However, a lot of it was the way it was taught,
using archaic language and without many practical examples.

After moving back to Jerusalem, I started working in the Tel Aviv hi-tech world.
In order to communicate effectively, I felt that I had to relearn how I explained things.
Now, I try to start and end with intuitive examples, and give the reason in the middle.
The first example shows my motivation for the explanation,
and I use the final example to walk through why the explanation makes sense.

At some point I realized – there is no reason why math can’t be explained in the same format.
A lot of the material I learned is legitimately really cool,
it’s just impossible to understand in the format of a math textbook.

The engineers I work with know what works.
They have a strong sense of how to build an application, how to test it.
I’ve noticed that sometimes, certain “good practices” aren’t just to make code more legible, or more efficient.
Sometimes there’s mathematical principles behind why one solution is better than the other.

I called my blog Applied in Theory.
My hope is to explain the ingenious solutions I see at work by exposing the underlying math.
The best part is that I naturally have the examples I need to show why the math matters and how it is used.
